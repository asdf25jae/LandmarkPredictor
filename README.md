# LandmarkPredictor
Used transfer learning to import ResNet50 CNN through the torch.nn modules in PyTorch to classify images into one of 10 landmarks. Dataset imported from the Google Landmark Recognition Challenge

Stochastic Gradient Descent through online learning (batch size left at 50), was used along with a negative log likelihood used as the loss function to minimize. 

Landmarks: 
    1. St. Stephanâ€™s Cathedral, Austria
    2. Teide, Spain
    3. Tallinn, Estonia
    4. Brugge, Belgium
    5. Montreal, Canada
    6. Itsukushima Shrine, Japan
    7. Shanghai, China
    8. Brisbane, Australia
    9. Edinburgh, Scotland
